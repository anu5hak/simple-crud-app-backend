**Simple CRUD API with Node.js, Express & MongoDB**

This is a beginner-friendly backend project where you build a fully functional CRUD API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB â€“ basically the backend part of the MERN stack (without React).

You'll learn how to:

Set up a Node.js and Express server

Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose

Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) products

Use tools like Postman for API testing

Organize routes, controllers, and models in a clean project structure

Store sensitive data securely using .env and .gitignore
